- Pixel Plunge was my final group project on the Northcoders bootcamp. As a group of 5, we had 8 days to build this from scratch. It is a deep sea fishing game, where the aim is to catch as many fish as possible before the oxygen runs out.
- Made with Phaser 3 as the game engine, React, and Firebase
- GitHub Repo : https://github.com/sting-arrays/pixel-plunge
